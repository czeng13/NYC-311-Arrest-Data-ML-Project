This is my semester-long  project for my Big Data Technologies course. The objective of this projet was to build a machine-learning piepline utilizing a cloud infrastructure with technologies such as AWS EC2, AWS S3, and Databricks for processing large amounts of data.


My project utilizes an Arrest Dataset and a 311 Service Requests dataset from NYC Open Data to predict if more complaints leads to more arrests. The main components of my project are data acquisition, exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, and data visualization with the results.
