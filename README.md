## Project Objectives

This is my semester-long project for my Big Data Technologies course. The objective of this projet was to build a machine-learning piepline utilizing a cloud infrastructure with technologies such as AWS EC2, AWS S3, and Databricks for processing large amounts of data.


My project utilizes an Arrest Dataset and a 311 Service Requests dataset from NYC Open Data to analyze the relationship between complaint counts and arrest counts. My pipeline follows a linear regression model with complaint_count, day_of_week, year, borough, and month as predictors and arrest_count as my target variable. The main components of my project are data acquisition, exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, and data visualization with the results.
